///! # Design
///! The SystemTimer is an RTIC monotonic timer that can be used for scheduling tasks in RTIC.
///! This timer is used in place of the cycle counter to allow the timer to tick at a slower rate
///! than the CPU clock. This allows for longer scheduling periods with less resolution. This is
///! needed for infrequent (e.g. multiple second) telemetry periods.

///
/// This implementation synchronizes access to the timer peripheral, so it is safe to copy/clone
/// and/or instantiate multiple timers. All timers will reference the same underlying hardware
/// clock.

/// This timer supports durations up to (just shy of) 5 days. Any duration larger than that will
/// wrap and behave incorrectly.
